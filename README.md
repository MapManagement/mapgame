I'm working on a small game that is written in python and will either use
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) or [arcade](https://arcade.academy/).
Since I never programmed any game, especially with python, I have to learn some
basics before getting in some more advanced features. As always feel free to contribute
to this repo.
