# Overview
----
I'm working on a small game that is written in python and will either use
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) or [arcade](https://arcade.academy/).
Since I never programmed any game, especially with python, I have to learn some
basics before getting in some more advanced features. As always feel free to contribute
to this repo.

# Game
----
I decided to create a game that could be called an "aim trainer". The goal is to hit
targets as fast as possible that appear on your screen. For each target you hit,
you get 1 point. Furthermore I already implemented some elements (targets, crosshair,
background...) that can be customized by choosing other files in the so called
"CustomizeView". But I'm planning on a feature that allows the player to import
any files he wants to use as a crosshair, target or something else. If you want
to share your ideas, simply just "pull request".

# ToDo
----
- [ ] implementing more game modes
- [x] fixing player sprite bug when opening MenuView

- [x] new player sprite bug, when choosing a new crosshair
- [ ] reducing loading times when switching views
- [ ] crosshair in front of GUI elements
